NAME
        klone - Clone a repository with git using a cache


SYNOPSIS
        klone [-hmlz] [-cCUT] <remote> [<local>]


DESCRIPTION
        A wrapper for [git clone] that caches remote klones. This wrapper does
        not implement [git clone] options.
        
        A cache of remote repos is maintained. If <remote> is not in the
        cache, clone it to the cache. Then, if <local> is given, clone the
        cached copy to <local> 

OPTIONS
        -h
            Invoke the argparse help.

        -z
            Remove any cached copy of <remote>. This will result in a fresh
            copy being cloned from <remote>.

        -m      
            Show this pseudo-man page.

        -l      
            List all user defined shortcutsi (see -cCUT).

        -cCUT
            Prefix the string <remote> with a user defines shortcut,
            alleviating the need to type out a full URL. (See ENVIRONMENT
            VARIABLES)


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

        R20_0326T_CACHE

            A required environment variable which names the directory to use
            as the root directory of the cacned clones. Eg:

                [$ export R20_0326T_CACHE=~/.cache/my/clone/cache].


        R20_0326T_CUT_{key}

            An optionial environment variable which defines a shortcut for use
            with the '-c' option. Eg:

                [$ export R20_0326T_CUT_g=https://github.com] and
                [$ export R20_0326T_CUT_s=https://github.com/longtallsally],

            in which case the following lines do the same thing:

                [$ klone https://github.com/longtallsally/repo dst]
                [$ klone -cg longtallsally/repo dst]
                [$ klone -ct repo dst].

            The value of {key} may be any continguous nonempty alphanumeric
            string.

BUGS
        This program wraps [git clone] but it DOES NOT IMPLEMENT (or pass on)
        any [git clone] options.
